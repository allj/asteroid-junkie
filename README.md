What is this?
=============

This is my grade 12 computer science final project. It consists of two games,
Asteroids and Space Junkie. The code is ugly since it's from highschool.

Run it with:

    java -jar Asteroid_junkie.jar


Asteroids
=========

You probably know what this is.

Controls
--------

WASD for movement, spacebar for weapon.


Space Junkie
============

I can't find the original anymore. Just think space invaders but better.


Controls
--------

Mouse for movement, click for weapon.
